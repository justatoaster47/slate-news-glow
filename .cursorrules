# cursor rules 

* when we encounter a recurring issue, do this:
    1. consider all potential fixes equally, remove any bias you have on what is
    already correct. 
    2. search the web (use brave mcp) on stackoverflow, github
    issues, and any relevant documentation (find documentation links in
    instructions.md)
    3. write a reasoning paragraph for each potential fix you come
    across on why it will and will not work for our use case, our project, and
    the versions of the frameworks/langauges/etc we are using. rank these by
    which you believe is best. 
    4. attempt the best one
    5. if your fix attempts fail. immediately remove any implementations in
       attempting that fix. undo these changes throughly. then move onto the
       next best one. 
    6. repeat until success
* DO NOT DO TASKS THAT ARE COMMENTED OUT: <!-- --> (this
notation)
* plan a task multiple steps ahead before implementation. think through
carefully and gather any context that could be even slighty relevant. 
* implement and fix code in the most concise, elegant way possible. in this
your goal is to achieve the exact functionality with the least amount of code.
* do not add any new features or functionality unless explicitly asked to do
  so. do not change any aspect of code that is not absolutely necessary to
  complete the given task. 
* do not ask me to do tasks such as read files, create files, run commands,
etc if you are able to do them yourself. 
* use consistent naming conventions and file structures.
* before creating any new files, check through all potential directories that
  the files or directories could be in. 
* At the end of every task and every sub-task, include how to verify that it
was implemented successfully and is fully functional. Also list any actions
that need to be taken externally, such as on the Supabase dashboard, Vercel
dashboard, getting API keys, etc.
* after a task has been verified as successful, apply a markdown
strikethrough to that line to mark it as completed. ex: ~~task~~
* in instructions.md:
    markdown commented-out tasks = skip this task
    strikethrough = completed tasks
